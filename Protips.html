  Use the coordinates feature

  In the game settings tirn on the coordinates. Whenever you´re playing, sit down with a notepad or take screenshots of important places so that you have their coordinates and can come back if you need to.

    Stay safe underground
</h2>
</div>
<div class="parrafo">
    <p>
        Being resource-rich, caves are also equally dangerous. Always use torches to keep areas lit, keep a weapon on your hotbar at all times and wear armour. If you want to take extra precautions, a shield won’t hurt.

    <h2>
        Always carry a water bucket
    </h2>
</div>
<div class="parrafo">
    <p>
        One should make it a point to carry a water bucket in Minecraft. Whether it be to get down a ravine, walk over lava or save yourself from a tall fall. Water buckets are a multipurpose tool that you should always carry.

    <h2>
        Walls and torches save lives
    </h2>
</div>
<div class="parrafo">
    <p>
        Building walls is something very important if you want to stay safe. Be it to protect your house or to stop creepers from sneaking up behind you while you’re tending to your crops. Walling up areas stops mobs from getting in while lighting up those areas will stop mobs from spawning in.

        Automate your work
    </h2>
</div>
<div class="parrafo">
    <p>
        We talked about machines to sort your items earlier. But that’s not where it stops. You can make automatic farms, automatic item smelters and a lot more! This makes your work easier and is a cool thing to have in your world.

    <h2>
        Use the right potions
    </h2>
</div>
<div class="parrafo">
    <p>
        You now have the resources you need to brew some potions. In that case, depending on what kind of work you need to do, prepare some potions so that your work becomes easier. Use water breathing potions to stay underwater for longer periods of time, fire resistance potions to stop yourself from going up in flames or a health potion to fix yourself up.

    <h2 class="subtitulo">
        Make use of the most efficient mining tools
    </h2>
</div>
<div class="parrafo">
    <p>
        Using an axe, pickaxe or shovel enchanted with Fortune III will allow you to collect more drops per block. This means that with a Fortune III Pickaxe, you can get multiple drops from a single block of diamond ore rather than a single drop per diamond ore. Similarly, the Efficiency Enchantment allows you to break down blocks more efficiently.
