        1. Learn the controls and functions. You can view a complete list of your Minecraft version's controls in de options of the keyboard

        2. Gather initial resources. Minecraft is largely about gathering and using the resources from the world around you. When starting out in Minecraft, you'll immediately need to gather the following:
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="parrafo">
      <p>
        3. Create a temporary house. Using dirt, gravel, and sand, build four walls and a roof for yourself. This will ensure that you have a place to hide when the world's night cycle begins.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="parrafo">
      <p>
        4. Build a crafting table. Crafting tables can be used to make almost anything in Minecraft. You can craft a crafting table inside of your inventory.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="parrafo">
      <p>
        5. Build a bed. Beds serve two purposes: they allow you to bypass the dangerous night cycle by sleeping through it, and they reset your spawn point to the last bed in which you rested. This means that should you die, you won't respawn at the beginning of the world; instead, you'll spawn next to your bed.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="parrafo">
      <p>
        6. Sleep in your bed as soon as night falls. As previously mentioned, this will allow you to skip the night cycle, which is when Minecraft's monsters (referred to as "mobs" in-game) appear.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="parrafo">
      <p>
        If you didn't have the chance to create a bed before nightfall, sit tight in your shelter until the sun comes back up.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="parrafo">
      <p>
        7. Craft some tools. Tools are the backbone of any successful Minecraft playthrough, as they allow you to obtain and craft objectively superior weapons, tools, and armor later in the game. You'll want to start out with the following tools:
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="parrafo">
      <p>
        8. Know the different kinds of mobs. While you may be tempted to run away from every animal and monster that you see, most mobs won't attack you unless you attack first:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="parrafo">
      <p>
        Peaceful - These mobs will never attack you, though they will flee if you attack them. Examples include most livestock (pigs, cows, sheep, etc.).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="parrafo">
      <p>
        Neutral - These mobs will not attack you unless you attack first. Examples include Endermen and Spiders (day only).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="parrafo">
      <p>
        Hostile - These mobs will always attack on sight. Examples include Zombies, Skeletons, and Spiders (night only).
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="parrafo">
      <p>
        9. Protect you with armour. The best way to protect yourself is armor. Like tools, you can make different armor out of different materials. However, unlike tools, you can only make leather, iron, gold, and diamond armor. There is also chain armor, however this is only attainable through villager trading.
